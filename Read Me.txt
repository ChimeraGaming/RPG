Hello to all those who read this,

I learned python June of 2021 and had inspiration to start
this little project here.

This is just a fun side project to do when i'm free, I don't
expect it to be anywhere close to done for at least a year
if not more. For now i'm calling it RPG until I get a more 
creative name for it. (It'll come in time.)

Feel free to check out the Update.txt to see when stuff was
added or being worked on.
