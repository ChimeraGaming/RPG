Hello to all those who read this,

I learned python June of 2021 and had inspiration to start
this little project here.

This is just a fun side project to do when i'm free, I don't
expect it to be anywhere close to done for at least a year
if not more. For now i'm calling it RPG until I get a more 
creative name for it. (It'll come in time.)

Feel free to check out the Update.txt to see when stuff was
added or being worked on.

- Must have Python installed.

To run this game, run it from the command line by typing python rpg_game.py. 
The game should display the player's stats and inventory, and prompt the player to press Enter to start the game. 
The player will then navigate through different levels, fight enemies, collect items, and ultimately face the boss monster to complete the game. 
Good luck and have fun!
